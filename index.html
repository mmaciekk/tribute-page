      Dave Matthews Band, also known by the initialism DMB, is an American rock band that was formed in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1991. They are the first group to have six consecutive studio albums debut in the top spot (Metallica would be the second to
      do so in 2016). As of 2010, the Dave Matthews Band has sold over 50 million records worldwide.

        <h3>Dave Matthews</h3>
        <p>
          Dave Matthews has chronicled his life’s travels so often that when asked, he can rattle off the details without pause. It goes like this: Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1967. Moves two years later with his family to Westchester County, NY, where
          his dad, a physicist, goes to work for IBM. Then, in the early `70s, to Cambridge, England, before returning to New York — where his dad died in 1977. The family moved back to South Africa in 1980, where Matthews went to a few different schools
          and “got more wise about the evils of government, there and in general.” O.K.; pause for a breath.

        <h3>Carter Beauford </h3>
        <p>
          Carter Beauford started on his music career at an early age — three years old. That’s when his father, who couldn’t find a baby sitter, took the toddler drummer-to-be to see the legendary Buddy Rich, which Beauford says “put the icing on the cake for
          me as far as what I wanted to do and what route to take. Believe it or not, I knew it was what I wanted to do then,” Beauford says. “My dad was a jazz trumpet player and kinda hipped me to the whole music scene. And he made it look like so much
          fun I decided to go ahead and pursue it.” Charlottesville, VA native Beauford largely lived behind his kit as a youth. “As long as I was on the drums, I was fine,” he says.

        <h3>Stefan Lessard</h3>
        <p>
          Bassist Stefan Lessard (aka Fonzy) is the youngest member of Dave Matthews Band, by a good seven years. He was just 16 when approached by the then bartender Dave Matthews who asked Stefan to join him, Carter Beauford and LeRoi Moore in their attempt to
          form a band. He was the perfect fit. Being so young, he saw the band as a continuation of his musical education and took the group very seriously. Still fresh in high school, he weaved simple yet strong bass lines proving to be an integral part
          of the new sound being created by the group.
